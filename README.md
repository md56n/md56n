# Hey there 👋

My name is Dawn Dixon and I'm an aspiring software developer. I just got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UMKC in December 2020.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-s-dixon).

When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming 🖥️, doing genealogy research 👪, or volunteering 😄!
